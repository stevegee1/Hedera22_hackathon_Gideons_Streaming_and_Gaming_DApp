#   INSPIRATION
The inspiration for this project comes from the convergence of typically two unrelated topics; Hip Hop and Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technologies. As a fan of Hip Hop culture, I began to pay more attention to Battle Rap, a subgenre of Hip Hop entertainment but in a sport-like format wherein two rappers face off in an acapella battle of lyricism, wordplay, and performance ability. As I began to follow Battle Rap more closely, it was clear that many of the rap battles did not end in a clear winner because there was no voting mechanism or fair judging in place to do so.

Simultaneously, I was spending a lot of time looking into blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, trying to wrap my head around it. Once I grasped the concept that an encrypted transaction, more specifically a ‘vote’, can be recorded on a distributed ledger, immutable and publicly verifiable, I soon realized that this was the perfect solution to the problem of the need for a fair voting mechanism for not just the battle rap leagues that I'm a fan of, but the 800+ battle rap leagues around the world.

Furthermore, I realized this can also be good to society as an example of how to successfully build a decentralized voting mechanism for any institution that would like to ensure truly fair and democratic online voting processes.

#  WHAT IT DOES?

Gideon is the new home for battle rap. It is a streaming, voting, and gaming platform for the battle rap industry. This means that battle rap leagues will be able to: stream rap battles live or pre-recorded from anywhere in the world, users can now vote on the outcome of rap battles using our decentralized voting mechanism, and with those statistics, users can then also safely participate in online fantasy gaming and betting for the first time.

We will also offer additional features such as league administration, digital & QR code ticketing, merchandising, ad leads, and more to registered leagues.
